# Design and Implementation

This website was inspired by Dr. [Trevor Bedford]'s lab website and adapted from [Drummond Lab]'s website which was based on Bedford Lab website. More technical details are below.

The site uses [Jekyll Bootstrap], and is deployed using [Netlify], which makes hosting a breeze. Keeping with a major Jekyll Bootstrap idea, the site separates content and presentation. Presentation information is stored in a new theme, the `lab` theme, which may be useful to other research groups setting up sites.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here].
