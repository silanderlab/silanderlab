We are interested in the interplay between phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic noise, and how these two traits have evolved in natural isolates of *E. coli*. To gain insight into this problem, we employ methods that allow us to observe single cells and their response to changes in environmental signals.

We are interested in the evolution of novel transcriptional control (e.g. changes in start sites, mRNA levels, or new small RNAs). We use RNA-seq of natural isolates of *E. coli* to quantify these changes. We also use these data in conjunction with information on protein levels to understand how selection differentially acts on mRNA and protein levels.

We use experimental evolution to in conjunction with information from natural isolates of *E. coli* to gain evolutionary insights in all of our research.
